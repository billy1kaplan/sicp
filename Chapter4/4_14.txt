The function accepted in map may not be handled by the underlying scheme
implementation. The function must be handled by our evaluator since it may not
be handled as a primitive procedure.

e.g. ('primitive map '(lambda (x) (- x)) (list 1 2 3)) will not be understood
by the underlying scheme interpreter
