(define (run-forever) (run-forever))

(define (try p)
  (if (halts? p p)
      (run-forever)
      'halted))

Assume that (try try) halts, then (try try) will never halt since we call (run-forever)
Assume that (try try) does not halt, then (try try) will halt with 'halted

Since the other functions are valid, this contradiction proves that writing the function "halts?" must be impossible.
