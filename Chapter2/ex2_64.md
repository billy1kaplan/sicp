a).
Final structure:

   1     9
    \   / \
     5 7   11

How it works:
1). Base case: To balance 0 elements, simply return an empty tree and any unbalanced elements, and we're done!
2). Recursive step: (Go from nth to nth-1 step)
    Three sub-tasks:
        a). Balance left half (Recursively)
        b). Extract current node (Extract here)
        c). Balance the right half (Recursively)
    Final step:
        - Combine these tasks: a TreeNode(Current, left_node, right_node)
Recurse down until done

b). At every step, the list is split into two halves which then must be recursively processed.
Only one element is fully processed at each step, the "current node" (central node).
This single element processing step must occur n times,
or the final size of the binary tree (assuming invariant that len(sorted_list) >= n)
Work done is ultimately proportional to O(n).
