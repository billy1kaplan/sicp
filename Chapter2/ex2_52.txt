2.52:

Since the painter is annoying in Dr. Racket, and I don't want to figure it out right now.

Here is, in writing, how I would solve this three part question:
Q1. Add some segments to the primitive wave painter of ex. 2.49.
Assuming we had sufficient artistic talent (i.e. willingness to draw something and then map)

Eyes:
- Drawn as line segments

Coordinate plane (0 1)

Eyes:
(define top-left-eye (make-vect 0.3 0.8))
(define bot-left-eye (make-vect 0.3 0.6))

(define top-right-eye (make-vect 0.7 0.8))
(define bot-right-eye (make-vect 0.7 0.6))

(define smile-left (make-vect 0.2 0.4))
(define smile-center-left (make-vect 0.3 0.3))
(define smile-center (make-vect 0.5 0.27))
(define smile-center-right (make-vect 0.7 0.3))
(define smile-right (make-vect 0.8 0.4))

(see ex2_49.scm)

(modify corner-split, can just play around)
