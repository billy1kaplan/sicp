To encode a symbol, runtime depends heavily on the structure of the tree.

At minimum, we first check if the letter is in the encoding tree which takes O(n) time.

For the tree in 2.71, encoding the most-frequent letter has complexity O(n).
The least-frequent, on the other hand, requires stopping at all n-1 nodes and checking which branch.
This leads to a complexity of ~O(n^2)
