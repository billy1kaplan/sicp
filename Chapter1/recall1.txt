Chapter 1: Building Abstractions with Procedures

Key Points: 
- Programming is about building complex prcoesses
    - Limitation is the imagination
    - Need to learn how to manage complexity
- Abstraction: Black box, do not need to know implementation, just the input and the output
- First-class functions: functions that can be passed around that any other data
- tail recursion: iterative process, other languages have synatic sugar for ( e.g. for, while, etc. )
- procedures can be used to make higher-order procedures
